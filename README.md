# SnakesAndLadders
A group project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack to create a browser game. In this case a twist on the classic Snakes & Ladders.

Browser Game:

Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

Have a dice to generate a random number from 1 - 6
Have a counter to navigate the board
Each square gives a task when landed on
Win condition at the end of the board
Button to reset page to start a new game

Extensions

Bonus tiles (forfeit, shots, shotgun, conditionals)
Animations (ex each time a player lands on a snake or ladder)
