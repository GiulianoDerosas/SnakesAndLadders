SnakesAndBladdered
A group project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack to create a browser game. In this case a twist on the classic Snakes & Ladders. As with classic snakes and ladders, a player rolls the dice and their counter moves accordingly; if the player lands on a ladder, they go up, if they hit a snake, they go down. However in Snakes and Bladdered there are also tiles which generate forfeits and tiles which give players a random amount of drinks.
